# DfAutonomousVehicle

The code for "DriveForwardFor3sec" worked yesterday. I tried to test the same exact code on my vehicle again and it would not run. I am not sure why it does not work anymore.


The code for "lidarSensing" works fine. I was able to get a clear reading when I placed a object behind the lidar. Now I am trying to communicate with my vehicle through a GPIO pin to tell it to stop and reverse when an object is detected behind it. I need help developing the code for this.


The code for "ledGPIOTesting", I tested a GPIO pin by giving it a "HIGH" signal and testing this with a LED. This code works fine also.
